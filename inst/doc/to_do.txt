• at loading, gamar should check whether GAMA is installed. If not, it
should return a message and give instructions on how to install GAMA.
• if GAMA is installed, find a way for gamar to automatically find the path to
the GAMA program
• in .onLoad: check whether the "gama" option is already defined. If yes,
what to do??? For now, just show an error message.
• remove the "gama" option in the onUnload() function, if it didn't exist
before the loading of the package. If it did, what to do then??? For now, just
show an error message.
